# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
I’m a **Senior Software Engineer** with 6 years and 10 months of turning big ideas (and coffee) into scalable software. On the front‑end I speak **Angular, React, and Next.js with TypeScript/JavaScript, plus the classics—HTML and CSS**. On the back‑end I build sturdy APIs with **Java, Node.js, and NestJS**, I script automations in **Python**, and I keep **MongoDB** happily humming. I’ve also wrangled a bit of **MySQL** and sprinkled projects onto **AWS** when the cloud calls. I thrive in **Agile teams—leading** when needed, collaborating always—and I’m obsessed with aligning technical decisions to real business outcomes. I’m a **lifelong learner** who enjoys shipping clean, creative solutions that make users smile and teammates high‑five.
